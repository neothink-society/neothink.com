# Chapter 21: The Corrupted Trial - Ego Justice Destroys Truth ⚖️💔

## 📖 Chapter Overview

Chapter 21 opens the "Separation" section with the devastating trial that tears apart the God-Man civilization. Despite Salinski's well-prepared case with powerful witnesses exposing Hammerschmidt's violent history, the trial becomes corrupted by ego justice as the judge tacitly joins the prosecution. Three prominent political witnesses create a false saint narrative about Hammerschmidt while the judge allows character assassination of defense witnesses. Salinski achieves a Neothink breakthrough exposing the ego-driven corruption, but the judge's unethical counter-instructions ensure a guilty verdict. The chapter climaxes with Teddy's heroic courtroom protest and ends with heart-wrenching individual farewells between Miss Annabelle and each student before prison separation.
