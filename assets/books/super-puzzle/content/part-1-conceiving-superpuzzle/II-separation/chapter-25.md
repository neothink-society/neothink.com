# Chapter 25: The Dangerous Journey Home - Love Conquers Legal Barriers 💕🌎

## 📖 Chapter Overview

Chapter 25 reveals the devastating scope of Ms. Minner's persecution through her INS affidavit calling John "the work of the devil himself," while documenting John's heroic and dangerous journey back to Miss Annabelle. After exploring three impossible options—waiting two years, Miss Annabelle fleeing to Australia, or John's illegal return—they choose love over law. John's border crossing adventure includes befriending a Mexican family and young Oscar, defending the boy from a violent racist in a fight that makes national news, and traveling across country in hiding. The chapter builds to the emotional climax of reunion just three days away.
