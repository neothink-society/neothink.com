## 📋 Remaining Manual Updates (Optional Enhancements)

### Priority 1: Phase Gates (High Value)

**File:** execute/priority-actions.md

**Add after Action 5 (before Phase 3):**
- Phase 1 → Phase 2 gate criteria
- Phase 2 → Phase 3 gate criteria
- Phase 3 → Phase 4 gate (CRITICAL with retention dependency)

**Source:** Use exact text from execute/DEPENDENCY-FOCUSED-UPDATES.md Section 1

**Impact:** Makes blocking relationships crystal clear, prevents premature scaling

---

### Priority 2: Investigation Protocols (High Value)

**File:** execute/data-quality-issues.md

**Add after "Week 1 Action Plan" section:**
- Protocol 1-4 with sequential dependencies
- Parallel track workflow diagram
- Minimum viable investigation option
- Effort estimates for prioritization

**Source:** Use exact text from execute/DEPENDENCY-FOCUSED-UPDATES.md Section 1

**Impact:** Teams know execution order based on dependencies (not arbitrary "Day 1-5")

---

### Priority 3: Retention Strategy (High Value)

**File:** execute/data-quality-issues.md OR new file execute/retention-strategy.md

**Add as new section:**
- Stage 1/2/3 framework (not Month 1/2/3)
- Completion criteria that unlock next stages
- Blocking relationship with Phase 4 explicit
- Retention vs SEO dependency matrix

**Source:** Use exact text from execute/DEPENDENCY-FOCUSED-UPDATES.md Section 2

**Impact:** Makes retention crisis solution path clear, shows Phase 4 dependency

---

### Priority 4: Critical Risks in Team Briefing (Medium Value)

**File:** TEAM-BRIEFING.md

**Add after "Key Opportunities" (before "Implementation Roadmap"):**
```markdown
## ⚠️ Critical Risks (Must Address)

### Week 1 Blockers:
1. GA4 Conversion Tracking Broken
2. Traffic Source Mystery
3. Retention Crisis

### Strategic Vulnerability:
4. Brand Dependency Risk

See [STRATEGIC-RISKS.md](STRATEGIC-RISKS.md) for complete assessment.
```

**Impact:** Honest framing in primary entry document

---

### Priority 5: Decision Tree Navigation (Medium Value)

**File:** README.md

**Replace "Where to Start" section:**
```markdown
## Where to Start (Decision Tree)

**👋 New team member?** → [TEAM-BRIEFING.md](TEAM-BRIEFING.md)

**⚠️ Week 1 execution team?** → [execute/data-quality-issues.md](execute/data-quality-issues.md)

**📊 Need metric clarity?** → [data/BASELINE-RECONCILIATION.md](data/BASELINE-RECONCILIATION.md)

**🚀 SEO implementation?** → [execute/priority-actions.md](execute/priority-actions.md)

**🎯 Specific opportunities?** → [opportunities/](opportunities/)

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Do not skip to Phase 4 without:
1. Week 1 investigation complete
2. Phases 1-3 validated
3. Retention improved to >5%
```

**Impact:** Clear navigation based on role/need

---

### Priority 6: Keyword Prioritization Matrix (Lower Priority)

**File:** strategy/keyword-priorities-phase-4.md (NEW)

**Content:** Tier 1/2/3 keyword targets from 48,548 analyzed
- Tier 1: Immediate targets (Months 1-3 of Phase 4)
- Tier 2: Growth expansion (Months 4-6)
- Tier 3: Long-tail strategy (Months 7-12)
- DO NOT START criteria (retention, Phases 1-3, GA4)

**Impact:** Prevents paralysis from 48K keywords with no prioritization

**Status:** Nice to have but not blocking (Phase 4 is months away)

- Documented in: STRATEGIC-RISKS.md, opportunities/4-keyword-expansion.md

### 5. Mobile CTR Excellence Despite Technical Issues
- 16.3% mobile CTR vs 9.95% desktop (64% higher)
