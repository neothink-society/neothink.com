## 🧠 The Mentality Evolution Theory

### Three Historical Mentalities

**1. Bicameral Mentality (3000+ years ago)**:
- Minds regularly hallucinated voices of gods from statues, tombs, pyramids
- Gods told people what to do and how to live
- No internal self-direction capability

**2. Current Mentality (Traditional)**:
- Instead of gods' voices, people let politicians and bureaucrats tell them how to live
- Still seeks external authorities for direction
- Functions in bicameral fashion with different authority sources

**3. God-Man Mentality (Future Evolution)**:
- Seeks direction from one's own honest, integrating mind
- No external authorities needed
- Internal mind authority supersedes all outside direction

### Political Structure Based on Mentality
**Revolutionary Understanding**: "Political structures are not based on political ideas; they're fundamentally based on man's mentality"

**Current System Obsolescence**: Government programs and regulations cannot survive new mentality that refuses external direction

**Natural Evolution**: As mankind evolves, Twelve Visions Party becomes "the only political survivor"

## ⚖️ The Prime Law - Fundamental of Protection

### Government's Single Function
**Protection Service Only**: Government reduced to defending individual and property rights from physical aggression

### The Complete Prime Law Text

**Preamble**:
- The purpose of human life is to prosper and live happily
- Government's function is to provide conditions for individual fulfillment
- Prime Law forbids initiatory force, fraud, or coercion

**Article 1**: No person, group, or government shall initiate force, threat of force, or fraud against any individual's self, property, or contract

**Article 2**: Force is morally-and-legally justified only for protection from violators of Article 1

**Article 3**: No exceptions shall exist for Articles 1 and 2

## 🏛️ The Political Transformation Programs

### The Great Replacement Program
- **Career Politician Elimination**: "Say good-bye forever to the career politician"
- **Businessman Leadership**: People with no interest in political careers join Twelve Visions Party
- **Performance Based**: Government runs "like a business based on people's performances, not elections"

### The Great Displacement Program
- **Private Sector Transfer**: Government programs move to private sector
- **Consumer Service**: "Millions of geniuses of society will be serving you — the consumer"
- **Political Agenda Elimination**: End of politicians serving themselves and political agendas

### The Economic Restructuring
**Government Sale**: Federal government sells everything unrelated to defense
- **Social Security Repayment**: Trillions generated repay every American's past contributions with interest
- **Program Termination**: Social Security ends after everyone repaid
- **Protection-Only Budget**: Less than half typical budget for defense functions only
